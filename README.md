In this Project I am focusing on creating a Website where i gather my experiences throughout my journey in the IMS.

## Development
I try to work on this Project whenever I have time and motivation to do so, which means progress might come fast at times and at others it may take longer. However I will try and keep working on this project until I finish the matura part of the IMS in order to have most of my own little projects nicely combined.
